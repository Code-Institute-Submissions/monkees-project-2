# CREATE A WEBSITE


Build a static (front-end only) website for a charity who advocate for the welfare of wild birds, with this particular site focusing on feral pigeons. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes.

The charity, Wild Bird Welfare Ireland, would like to create an educational website aimed both at the general public and teachers with myth-busting facts about feral pigeons and their welfare. 

- The main purpose of the site is to raise awareness of pigeon welfare by educating the public with fun facts. 
- The main target audience, apart from the general public and animal lovers, is teachers in schools who could use the information packs for fun and educational activities with their students.
- A secondary purpose is to recruit volunteers and supporters. 

- The charity has been given a government grant to distribute information packs and "I love feral pigeons stickers". Users of the site should be able to apply to have an information pack sent to them. 
- Users should also be able to contact the charity to express interest in volunteering with the charity, for example by helping with a pigeon census of their area.
- Users should be able to follow the charity on social media eg. Facebook, twitter.

The charity has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
- Photos of pigeons
- A video clip
- Audio clips
- Text with fun facts about pigeons
- A day in the life of a pigeon timeline text

The branding, colours and typography should be appealing and fun, but professional, and give a sense of the beauty of the common pigeon. Here is a selection of imagery presented as a moodboard to get some inspiration for colours and typography:
